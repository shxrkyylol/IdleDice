The Idle Dice Hack.

All of these codes have been obtained by me (@shxrkyylol) and put into 1 repo for you all to enjoy!
I am currently working on a python script to make it so you can generate literally ANY codes op or not.
The code will be obfuscated as I dont want people kinda like backdooring the code I guess is how I explain it

But yeah, to import the codes, go to coolmathgames.com/0-idle-dice and let the game load. Once there, click the gear button, and hit "Import Save" and then, copy your favorite code, and paste it there.
